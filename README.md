This repository has the following content:
- Motor Stage Class : A Matlab class was developed based on existing code by Andriy Chmyrov (from Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen), and posteriorly extended by Julan A.J. Fells (from Dept. Engineering Science, University of Oxford). The new class builds on top of the previous class by adding a new Thorlabs series of controllers (Thorlabs BSC201, BSC202 and BSC203), expands the use of the other controllers to work with both rotation and linear stages, adds new functions and makes the class compatible with both 32 and 64-bit Matlab libraries.
- THR-100-010 : Slit 1 mm compatible with Thorlabs Cage 30 mm system and Thorlabs SM1 external tube.
- THR-100-015 : Slit 1.5 mm. Check THR-100-010 for more details.
- THR-100-020 : Slit 2 mm. Check THR-100-010 for more details.
- THR-100-030 : Slit 3 mm. Check THR-100-010 for more details.
- THR-100-050 : Slit 5 mm. Check THR-100-010 for more details.
- THR-101-110 : Adapter between Thorlabs Cage 30 mm, Thorlabs SM1 external tube and Hamamatsu detectors with heatsink of the A3179 series.
- Thorlabs IP250-BV P/N-type laser diodes : Modification of the IP250-BV laser diode drive board to operate with n-type and p-type laser diodes.
