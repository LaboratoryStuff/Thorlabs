This repository has the following content:
- Motor Stage Class : A Matlab class was developed based on existing code by Andriy Chmyrov (from Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen), and posteriorly extended by Julan A.J. Fells (from Dept. Engineering Science, University of Oxford). The new class builds on top of the previous class by adding a new Thorlabs series of controllers (Thorlabs BSC201, BSC202 and BSC203), expands the use of the other controllers to work with both rotation and linear stages, adds new functions and makes the class compatible with both 32 and 64-bit Matlab libraries.
- THR-100-010 : Slit 1 mm compatible with Thorlabs Cage 30 mm system and Thorlabs SM1 external tube.
- THR-100-015 : Slit 1.5 mm. Check THR-100-010 for more details.
- THR-100-020 : Slit 2 mm. Check THR-100-010 for more details.
- THR-100-030 : Slit 3 mm. Check THR-100-010 for more details.
- THR-100-050 : Slit 5 mm. Check THR-100-010 for more details.
- THR-101-110 : Adapter between Thorlabs Cage 30 mm, Thorlabs SM1 external tube and Hamamatsu detectors with heatsink of the A3179 series.
- THR-102-030 : Fixed aperture 3 mm diameter. Check THR-102-050 for more details.
- THR-102-040 : Fixed aperture 4 mm diameter. Check THR-102-050 for more details.
- THR-102-050 : Fixed aperture 5 mm diameter compatible with Thorlabs Cage 30 mm system, Thorlabs SM1 external tube and optical posts with M4 thread.
- THR-102-060 : Fixed aperture 6 mm diameter. Check THR-102-050 for more details.
- THR-102-070 : Fixed aperture 7 mm diameter. Check THR-102-050 for more details.
- THR-120-010 : Adapter between Thorlabs Cage 60 mm, Thorlabs SM2 external tube and optical post with set screw M4.
- THR-120-020 : Adapter between Thorlabs Cage 60 mm, Thorlabs Cage 30 mm, Thorlabs SM1 external tube and optical post with set screw M4.
- Thorlabs Camera Class: A Matlab class was developed to get images from Thorlabs cameras compatible with uc480DotNet.dll. This class was tested with a single Thorlabs DCC1545M camera and with ThorCam 64-bits. Nonetheless, this class is designed to operate with other Thorlabs cameras of the same family.
- Thorlabs IP250-BV P/N-type laser diodes : Modification of the IP250-BV laser diode drive board to operate with n-type and p-type laser diodes.
